# Bamazon

This app uses a mySQL server to track inventory in a store called Bamazon.

There are two seperate files: bamazonCostumer.js, and bamazonManager.js. In bamazonCostumer, the user can purchase items from the store, and the quantity will be affected respectively. In bamazonManager, the user is able to view products, low inventory, add inventory, and add products.

Remember to run `npm install` before running the program to download all the necessary dependencies.
